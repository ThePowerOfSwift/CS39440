    <string name="purpose">This App is designed to create Sudokus, capture images of Sudokus, then
        using optical character recognition, allow them to be completed in the App. Additionally it
        will identify solutions on these so that uses can check their accuracy.
        \nThis Application was created as part of my Major project for university. As such, it
        needed to demonstrate my ability to develop software and write efficient code, all whist
        following a software development methodology to achieve the stated goal.</string>
